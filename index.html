<h1>Metro Maps on Octilinear Grid Graphs</h1>
<h3>By Georg Schenzel 01633078 & Viktoria Pundy 01633403</h3>
<div>This project is based on the paper <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.1111/cgf13986">Metro Maps on Octilinear Grid Graphs</a> by Bast et al.</div>
<div>The paper proposes an algorithm for drawing public transport maps on an octilinear grid graph.
Such a graph allows each edge to be drawn vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Stations are displayed
as nodes of the graph. Our implementation of the algorithm takes data in GTFS-Format as input
    and provides a resulting drawing of the contained lines as output.
    We provide data of four cities for the graph, however, the users can upload their own files as well.

<div>At the start of the project, the users can choose between four prepared datasets
(Vienna, Rome, Prague and Detroit) as well as upload their own files, which have to be in GTFS format.
Note that the upload and parsing of the data can take some time. Afterwards, the users can choose which lines
    should be drawn in the graph as well as set rules regarding the names of the lines. When the lines have been chosen,
    the graph is drawn in the browser. On the right side of the window is a list of all lines with their default colours.
    If no colour was specified in the data, the colour is set to black. With a click on the colour bar, the colour can
    be adjusted for each line individually.

</div>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
The algorithm was implemented with TypeScript and Angular. The drawing of
the graph is done with the library d3.js
