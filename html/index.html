<h1 style="text-align: center">Metro Maps on Octilinear Grid Graphs</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center">By Georg Schenzel 01633078 & Viktoria Pundy 01633403</h3>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://vcpy.github.io/Octilinear_Maps/">Link to the Project on Github Pages</a></div>
<div>This project is based on the paper <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.1111/cgf13986">Metro Maps on Octilinear
    Grid Graphs</a> by Bast et al.
</div>
<div>The paper proposes an algorithm for drawing public transport maps on an octilinear grid graph.
    Such a graph allows each edge to be drawn vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Stations are displayed
    as nodes of the graph. Our implementation of the algorithm takes data in GTFS-Format as input
    and provides a resulting drawing of the contained lines as output.
    We provide data of four cities for the graph, however, the users can upload their own files as well.
</div>
<br/>
<div>At the start of the project, the users can choose between four prepared datasets
    (Vienna, Rome, Prague and Detroit) as well as upload their own files, which have to be in GTFS format.
    Note that the upload and parsing of the data can take some time. Afterwards, the users can choose which lines
    should be drawn in the graph as well as set rules regarding the names of the lines. When the lines have been chosen,
    the graph is drawn in the browser. On the right side of the window is a list of all lines with their default
    colours.
    If no colour was specified in the data, the colour is set to black. With a click on the colour bar, the colour can
    be adjusted for each line individually.

</div>
<h2>UI</h2>
<div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row">
    <img src="First_popup.PNG" style="width: 700px"/>
    <p class="paragraph">In the first window, the users can choose either one of the four prepared datasets or upload
        their own files in GTFS
        format.
        Note that the upload of files can take some time.</p>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row; margin-top: 1em">
    <img src="Second_popup.PNG" style="width: 700px"/>
    <p class="paragraph">In the second window, the user can choose which lines should be drawn in the graph. The lines
        can be chosen individually
        in the list on the left. Additionally, the user can establish rules about the names of the lines which should be
        selected. The user
        can choose how the names should start, should not start, should end and should not end. Additionally, a certain type of
        transport can be selected. Multiple strings can be
        separated by a comma.
        At the bottom, the user can choose if lines are allowed to cross each other in the graph and set the scale of
        the drawn graph.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <img src="window.PNG" style="width: 100%"/>
    <p>Afterwards the graph is drawn in the browser window. On the right is a list with the drawn lines. Each line has a
        color
        bar. Clicking on the bar reveals a colour picker with which the colour of the according line can be changed.
        When hovering over the graph elements, the name of the lines and the stations are shown.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
The algorithm was implemented with TypeScript and Angular. The drawing of
the graph is done with the library d3.js
